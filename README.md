# Repository of Flutter Apps

I made these apps while creating an App Development with Flutter curriculum in my stint at TinkerTanker. It is meant to introduce secondary to JC students with little to no programming background to app development.

I made step-by-step instructions in slides for students to follow the lesson, as well as starter code to help them save lesson time.
